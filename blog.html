        I have released InfiniSweeper version 1.0! It's based on the website 1000mines and was a fun challenge to make! It took about a week to make.

        I remade my remake of protobowl. Eventually I might add more features, but for now it pretty much does whatever protobowl does, except multiplayer, because I would need to have a dedicated server for that. Try it out through the featured projects!

        Starting a new project - ELEM5. It's a simple elemental clone that I hope to work on over the next few weeks. Right now it's very simple, but I'll keep adding more features. To play it, select first element with left click, second element with right click, and press enter to combine them. Recipies are very limited for now, but I'll be working on that.

        Added some new features to the webiste. Firstly, an easy way to add new posts and a dark mode, which you can see in the top right corner. It saves your mode in the cookies, unlike some websites.

        Website redesign time! The old one looked bad (let's be honest here), so now it hopefully looks better! Any feedback is appreciated.
